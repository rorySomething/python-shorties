## Sudoku Solver
Just trying out backtracking and comparing its performance to how I'd play.  Might look better performance-wise with less terminal output.
Might experiment with image recognition to read in puzzles much later.

## Kenken Solver
More backtracking, similar to sudoku but more complicated to implement the layout and rules.
Copied and modified from Sudoku almost no changes to the backtracking code, lots of unused leftovers to cleanout.  Doesn't read in puzzles any pleasant way.
